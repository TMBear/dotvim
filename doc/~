MY PLAN FOR TODAY (11:08 AM)
* update analysis code to account for photodiode gain 
* rerun experiment from Friday
* update labview code to take the spectra at each position
* analyze any data I get from this
* finish dielectric layers simulationk

GAIN COMPENSATION  (11:33 AM)
Once again, the question is whether it is better to compensate for the gain in the labview code, or in the python?  I think it is better to compensate for in the labview, as I don't see it ever changing... maybe it would be best to have a calibration step, where the sample is removed, and then ratio of I to I_0 is calculated.

If I have the mean(I/I0) with no sample, how do I best incorporate it into the absorption calculation?  I divied before taking the mean...

I think this is finished.

FRIDAY'S EXPERIMENT RERUN (12:11 PM)
Unfortuneatly, I somehow deleted my notes from the experiment on Friday, so I don't know the exact power I was using.
