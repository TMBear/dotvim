This directory contains a number of items that are neccessary for working on windows.

console.xml -- these are my custom settings for console2, place it in the directory where console was installed.

clear.bat -- clears command prompt (like in linux)
cdh.bat -- convenience script (goes to the desktop of the current user)
updatevimrc.bat -- creates necessary directories for temporary files, also creates symbolic links to the relevant files
